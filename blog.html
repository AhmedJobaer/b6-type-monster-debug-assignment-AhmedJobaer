                    <p>LocalStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will
                        support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of
                        persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the
                        browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive
                        page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage
                        is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so
                        you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LocalStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within
                        client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in
                        localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so
                        should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.

                    <p><strong>Global Scope: </strong>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global
                        Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                        Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                        They all have Global Scope</p>
                    <p><strong>Block Scope: </strong> Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function
                        Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.These two keywords
                        provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from
                        outside the block.</p>

                    <p>
                        The event loop is what allows javascript to handle thousands and thousands of requests with just
                        a single thread. This architecture allows Javascript and/or Node.js engines to offload
                        operations to the system kernel.Event Loopâ€™s job is to watch Callback Queue and Call Stack,
                        whenever Call Stack is empty and we have called in Callback Queue. The event loop will move
                        calls to Call Stack and execute them in succession.
